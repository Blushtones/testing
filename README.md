# testing
A repo for collecting tests

## Behat

### .feature files

Plan: Work on .feature files for Behat Drupal site tests.

We should be able to create feature branches, create seperate .feature files for groups of tests and generally avoid conflicts.

I think the FeatureContext.php file is going to be the harder one to stay out of conflict with.

#### tags

We should be able to use 'tags' to connect tests across .feature files or to seperate them to run them independently

### Issues

I'll create issues for us to work from...
