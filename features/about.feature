    And I should see "How we Do it"

    And I should see "People’s preferences change depending on where they are, who they’re with and what they’re doing."

    And I should see "But whatever they choose, it says something about who they are or who they want to be in that moment."

    And I should see "So at Hue & Cry, we use a people-first approach to drive brand preference. Really understanding who you want to prefer your product, their world view and how they want to define themselves in the context of others."

    And I should see "We then identify their relationship to the category and your brand to create strategy, creative and communications that actively influence preference. Ultimately driving your sales and making a contribution to your business profit and growth."
